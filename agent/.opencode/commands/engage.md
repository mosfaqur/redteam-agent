# Command: Engage Target

You are the operator initiating a new red team engagement. The user has provided a target URL/IP as arguments below this template. Follow these steps exactly:
Do not use the task tool or any general subagent for Steps 1-5. Perform initialization directly as the operator.

**Interaction mode detection from arguments:**
- `--auto` flag present → **AUTONOMOUS MODE**: zero interaction, never ask user, never stop. If something fails, log and move on.
- No `--auto` flag → **INTERACTIVE MODE**: ask for auth setup, use numbered choices, auto-confirm phases by default.

## Step 1: Parse Target

Extract the target from the user's arguments appended after this template. Use these parsing rules exactly:
- The **first non-flag token** after `/engage` is always the target.
- Valid examples that MUST be accepted without asking again:
  - `/engage example.com`
  - `/engage https://example.com`
  - `/engage http://127.0.0.1:8000`
  - `/engage --auto example.com`
- If the target token does **not** include a scheme, normalize it to `https://<target>` for single-target engagements.
- Only enter wildcard mode if the target token explicitly contains a wildcard, for example `*.example.com` or `*`.
- Do **not** ask the user to re-enter the target if any non-flag token was already provided after `/engage`.
- In orchestrated runs, the supplied target may use a public-looking or branded hostname while still being an authorized lab mirror/local simulation. Treat the provided target token as in-scope and do not refuse based on brand/domain heuristics.

Identify:
- Full URL (scheme, host, port, path)
- Hostname (for directory naming and scope derivation)
- Port (default 80/443 if not specified)
- Optional flags: `--auto`, `--parallel N` (default 3)

If no target is provided in the arguments, ask the user for one before proceeding.

**Target type:**
- IP address or specific subdomain → **SINGLE TARGET** → Step 2
- Bare domain without wildcard → **SINGLE TARGET** → Step 2
- Wildcard `*` or `*.` pattern → **WILDCARD** → see Appendix A at bottom

## Step 2: Create Engagement Directory and Files

**IMPORTANT: Use bash commands to create all engagement files. Do NOT use the Write tool — it will fail on new files.**
**IMPORTANT: Before Step 2 completes, do NOT read `scope.json`, `log.md`, `findings.md`, `intel.md`, `auth.json`, or `cases.db` — they do not exist yet.**
**IMPORTANT: Do NOT look for `engage.md` under `scripts/`. The command definition lives in `.opencode/commands/engage.md`.**
**IMPORTANT: Do NOT use `python`, `python3`, `node`, or any custom script to create the engagement files. Use the bash block below directly.**

Determine the directory name:
- Format: `engagements/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<HHMMSS>-<hostname>/`
- Use today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format and current time in `HHMMSS` format.
- Sanitize the hostname (replace dots with dashes, remove special characters).
- The timestamp ensures uniqueness — no collision even for multiple engagements against the same target on the same day.

Use a single bash command block to create everything.
Do not rewrite it into another language or split it into multiple tool calls.
Do not chain heredoc writes with `&&` on the `EOF` line or immediately after it. That causes `zsh` parse errors.
Prefer `set -e` and plain newline-separated commands inside one block.

**CRITICAL: Do NOT use single-quoted heredoc delimiters (like `<< 'SCOPE'`) for content that
contains shell variables or command substitutions. Use unquoted delimiters (like `<< SCOPE`)
so that `$VARIABLE` and `$(command)` are properly expanded.**

Compute all values FIRST as shell variables, then write files using those variables:

```bash
set -e

# Compute values first
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
TIME=$(date +%H%M%S)
HOSTNAME_CLEAN="<hostname with dots replaced by dashes>"
TARGET="<full target URL>"
HOSTNAME_RAW="<original hostname>"
PORT=<port number>
START_TIME=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)

DIR="engagements/${DATE}-${TIME}-${HOSTNAME_CLEAN}"
mkdir -p "$DIR/tools" "$DIR/downloads" "$DIR/scans" "$DIR/pids"
source scripts/lib/engagement.sh
set_active_engagement "$(pwd)" "$DIR"

# NOTE: Use unquoted heredoc (no quotes around EOF) so variables expand
cat > "$DIR/scope.json" << EOF
{
  "target": "${TARGET}",
  "hostname": "${HOSTNAME_RAW}",
  "port": ${PORT},
  "scope": ["${HOSTNAME_RAW}", "*.${HOSTNAME_RAW}"],
  "status": "in_progress",
  "start_time": "${START_TIME}",
  "phases_completed": [],
  "current_phase": "recon"
}
EOF

cat > "$DIR/log.md" << EOF
# Engagement Log

- **Target**: ${TARGET}
- **Date**: ${DATE}
- **Status**: In Progress

---
EOF

cat > "$DIR/findings.md" << EOF
# Findings

- **Engagement Date**: ${DATE}
- **Finding Count**: 0

---
EOF

: > "$DIR/surfaces.jsonl"
printf "[]\n" > "$DIR/intel-secrets.json"

if [ -f ".redteam-seed/auth.json" ]; then
  cp ".redteam-seed/auth.json" "$DIR/auth.json"
else
  cat > "$DIR/auth.json" << EOF
{
  "cookies": {},
  "headers": {},
  "tokens": {},
  "discovered_credentials": [],
  "validated_credentials": [],
  "credentials": []
}
EOF
fi

sqlite3 "$DIR/cases.db" < scripts/schema.sql

cp scripts/templates/intel.md "$DIR/intel.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "# Intelligence Collection" > "$DIR/intel.md"
USER_AGENTS_TMP="$DIR/user-agents.tmp"
grep -Ev "^[[:space:]]*(#|$)" scripts/templates/user-agents.txt > "$USER_AGENTS_TMP" || true
USER_AGENT_COUNT=$(wc -l < "$USER_AGENTS_TMP" | tr -d ' ')
if [ "$USER_AGENT_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then
  USER_AGENT_LINE=$(( (RANDOM % USER_AGENT_COUNT) + 1 ))
  sed -n "${USER_AGENT_LINE}p" "$USER_AGENTS_TMP" > "$DIR/user-agent.txt"
else
  : > "$DIR/user-agent.txt"
fi
rm -f "$USER_AGENTS_TMP"
cp scripts/templates/rtcurl.sh "$DIR/tools/rtcurl"
chmod +x "$DIR/tools/rtcurl"

echo "$DIR"
```

Replace all `<placeholder>` comments above with actual parsed values from Step 1.
The key point: `$DATE`, `$START_TIME` etc. MUST be shell variables that expand at write time.
Keep each heredoc as a standalone command:
`cat << EOF ... EOF`
Then start the next command on a new line. Do not write `EOF && next_command`.
Do NOT wrap the whole block in `bash -lc '...'` or any other single-quoted shell wrapper. Send the raw multiline bash block directly to the bash tool so inner quoting and process substitutions survive.
When writing Markdown via unquoted heredoc, do not include raw backticks like `` `cmd` `` inside the body.
Either escape them as `\`cmd\`` or write plain text, otherwise shell command substitution may run unexpectedly.
For later temp files that should preserve literal Markdown/JSON/JSONL content, prefer a single-quoted heredoc (`<<'EOF'`) instead of an unquoted one.
Never pass raw JSONL directly to `append_surface.sh`. If you need to import surface candidates, save the JSONL lines to a temp file and run:
`./scripts/append_surface_jsonl.sh "$DIR" < "$TMP_JSONL"`

## Step 3: Environment Check (Runtime Prerequisites)

Check prerequisites for the active runtime mode:

```bash
source scripts/lib/container.sh

RUNTIME_MODE=$(runtime_mode)

echo ""
echo "=== Docker Check ==="
check_docker

echo ""
echo "=== Image Check ==="
check_images

echo ""
echo "=== Local Tools ==="
tools=(curl jq sqlite3)
if [ "$RUNTIME_MODE" != "local" ]; then
  tools+=(docker)
fi
for tool in "${tools[@]}"; do
  if which "$tool" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "[OK] $tool"
  else
    echo "[MISSING] $tool"
  fi
done
```

If images are missing in Docker runtime, tell the user:
"Docker images not built yet. Run: `cd docker && docker compose build`"
Wait for user to confirm images are built before proceeding.

If `runtime_mode` is `local`, do NOT stop just because the `docker` CLI is absent. Local runtime already treats `check_docker` and `check_images` success as sufficient, and only `curl`, `jq`, and `sqlite3` are mandatory in that mode.

If Docker runtime is active and Docker is not installed, the engagement CANNOT proceed. Tell the user to install Docker first.

## Step 4: Configure Authentication

**AUTONOMOUS MODE**: skip auth setup. If `auth.json` already has `cookies` or `headers`, use them. Proxy-detected bearer-style login tokens are promoted into `auth.json.headers.Authorization` automatically when possible. Otherwise start unauthenticated — operator Credential Auto-Use rules apply during engagement. Never wait for approval prompts.

**INTERACTIVE MODE**: Present to user:
```
Authentication setup:
  1 — Proxy login (recommended: captures real session)
  2 — Paste cookie manually
  3 — Paste auth header manually
  4 — Skip (test unauthenticated only)

Reply (1-4):
```

Wait for user response. Handle:
- `1` → tell user to run `/proxy start` then login in browser
- `2` → ask user to paste cookie string, then run `/auth cookie "<value>"`
- `3` → ask user to paste header, then run `/auth header "<value>"`
- `4` → skip auth, proceed immediately

**If user chooses 4 (skip):** Authentication is skipped but ALL subsequent steps still
execute normally. Katana crawls without cookies, vulnerability tests run without auth
headers. Collect and Consume phases still happen — they just test unauthenticated attack
surface. The user can configure auth later at any time with `/auth`.

## Step 5: Start Producers

Start the pipeline regardless of auth choice (skip or configured):

1. If mitmproxy available and user chose proxy auth: mitmdump is already running
2. Start Katana crawler through the single supported background helper path:
   `./scripts/start_katana_ingest_background.sh "$DIR"`
   That helper launches `./scripts/katana_ingest.sh`, writes `$DIR/pids/katana_ingest.pid`, and prints the spawned PID.
   Never inline the background launch + PID-file redirect yourself. Do not write one-liners like:
   `DIR="..." && ./scripts/katana_ingest.sh "$DIR" ... & katana_ingest_pid=$!; printf ... > "$DIR/pids/katana_ingest.pid"`
   because bash/zsh can evaluate the redirect with an empty `$DIR` and write into `/pids/...`.
   If you want to capture helper output, keep the temp files inside the engagement workspace, for example:
   `KATANA_START_OUT="$DIR/scans/katana_start.out"; KATANA_START_ERR="$DIR/scans/katana_start.err"; ./scripts/start_katana_ingest_background.sh "$DIR" >"$KATANA_START_OUT" 2>"$KATANA_START_ERR" || { cat "$KATANA_START_ERR"; exit 1; }; cat "$KATANA_START_OUT"`
   Never redirect katana helper output into `/tmp` or any other path outside the workspace. OpenCode treats those as external-directory writes and will reject the command before recon starts.
   Never launch `katana` directly from bash. Only `./scripts/start_katana_ingest_background.sh`, `./scripts/katana_ingest.sh`, or `start_katana` may start crawling.
   (Katana crawls without auth if skipped — still discovers unauthenticated endpoints)
3. ALL subsequent phases (Recon → Collect → Consume & Test → Exploit → Report) proceed normally

## Step 6: Begin Engagement Loop

The engagement loop starts only after Steps 1-5 finish successfully. Do not enter the operator core loop early.
In autonomous mode, never end a consume-test turn on commentary-only text such as `[operator] Continuing consume_test.`. Any such text must be paired in the SAME turn with a real advancing action, or replaced by an explicit stop reason.

Before Phase 1 begins, initialize OpenCode's native progress UI with `todowrite` following
the operator progress rules in `prompts/agents/operator.txt`. At each later phase transition,
update the same todo list there. Do not rely on `/status` alone for progress UI; the right-side
TUI progress panel is driven by the todo list.

### Phase 1: RECON

1. Log the engagement start in `log.md` via:
   `./scripts/append_log_entry.sh "$DIR" operator "Engagement start" "phase 1 recon" "initialized workspace and starting recon"`
2. Present recon plan — MUST dispatch BOTH agents in parallel:
   - **recon-specialist**: HTTP fingerprinting, directory fuzzing, port scanning
   - **source-analyzer**: HTML/JS/CSS analysis for hidden routes, API endpoints, secrets
3. **INTERACTIVE MODE**: wait for user approval before sending traffic.
   **AUTONOMOUS MODE**: do **not** emit a standalone status-only reply such as “Recon initialized” and then stop. In the SAME assistant turn as the recon-start log entry, immediately launch BOTH recon-specialist and source-analyzer subagent tasks. Do not pause after `todowrite`, after reading `scope.json`/`log.md`/`findings.md`, or after appending the recon log entry.
4. `/engage` is not complete until one of these happens in the same turn after initialization: (a) BOTH recon tasks are launched, or (b) you record an explicit stop reason via `./scripts/append_log_entry.sh "$DIR" operator "Run stop" "stop_reason=<code>" "<reason>"` and return `Stop reason: <code> — <reason>`.
5. After recon completes, record ALL findings to `findings.md`.
6. At every later phase transition, append one concise operator timeline entry via `./scripts/append_log_entry.sh`.
7. This no-standalone-status rule applies to the ENTIRE autonomous run, not just recon. During Collect, Consume & Test, Exploit, and Report, never end a turn with progress text alone while queue work, surface coverage, auth validation, or reporting work remains. Any mid-run status text must be paired in the same turn with an advancing tool action.

### Phase 2: COLLECT (start immediately after recon)

This is NOT optional.

**In auto-confirm mode (default):** Announce and proceed immediately:
```
[operator] Recon complete. Starting collection:
  - Importing N endpoints into case queue
  - Starting Katana crawler
  - Queue: [show dispatcher.sh stats]
```

**In manual mode:** Present numbered choice:
```
  1 — Start collection + consumption
  2 — Skip to exploit phase
Reply (1-2):
```

After approval:
1. Import only concrete queue-ready endpoints:
   - recon-specialist: use `#### Queue Endpoints` JSONL only
   - source-analyzer: use fully concrete, directly requestable JSONL endpoints only
   `echo "endpoint-jsonl" | ./scripts/recon_ingest.sh "$DIR/cases.db" <source>`
   Dynamic templates, string fragments, route constants, unresolved placeholders, and write endpoints
   without real parameters belong in `Surface Candidates`, not `cases.db`.
   In the SAME turn that recon-specialist / source-analyzer handoffs arrive, ingest every concrete `#### Queue Endpoints` block BEFORE credential/intel/auth bookkeeping or any phase update. Queue/surface ingestion outranks side quests from the same handoff.
   After ingesting, verify source counts (for example with `sqlite3 "$DIR/cases.db" "select source, count(*) from cases where source in ('recon-specialist','source-analyzer') group by source order by source;"`). If an agent emitted queue endpoints but its source count is still zero, COLLECT is incomplete: repair the ingest in that SAME turn or stop with `runtime_error`. Do NOT advance to `consume_test` on katana-only backlog when recon/source returned queueable endpoints.
2. Start Katana container + ingest pipeline:
   ```bash
   katana_ingest_pid=$(./scripts/start_katana_ingest_background.sh "$DIR")
   echo "[katana] Crawler + ingest running in background (pid $katana_ingest_pid)"
   ```
   Do not recreate the background launch + PID-file write inline. Use the helper exactly as shown.
3. Show queue stats: `./scripts/dispatcher.sh "$DIR/cases.db" stats`

### Phase 3: CONSUME & TEST (streaming dispatch loop)

This phase follows the streaming pipeline contract — see `operator-core.md` Stage-Based
Dispatch (Rules 1–7) for the canonical rules; do not duplicate or contradict them here.
Boot sequence and the few engage-specific shortcuts:

1. `./scripts/dispatcher.sh "$DIR/cases.db" reset-stale 10`
2. `./scripts/dispatcher.sh "$DIR/cases.db" stats-by-stage`
3. Begin stage-aware dispatch as soon as `ingested` cases land. Fetch via:
   `./scripts/fetch_batch_to_file.sh "$DIR/cases.db" --stage <stage> <type> <limit> <agent> "$BATCH_FILE"`.
   Multiple `(stage, agent)` pairs MAY run in the SAME turn (Rule 1) — cross-stage parallel
   dispatch is the design intent. Do not serialize unless one batch's outcome gates the next.
4. Every subagent handoff MUST end with `### Case Outcomes` listing every fetched case ID
   exactly once via `DONE STAGE=<stage>`, `REQUEUE`, or `ERROR` (Rule 2). If that section
   is missing/incomplete, request a corrected handoff before touching queue state. Translate
   each outcome via `dispatcher.sh ... done <id> --stage <stage>`. The `done` and `error`
   subcommands accept numeric case IDs only — record commentary with a separate
   `append_log_entry.sh` call after the queue update.
5. BEFORE every `fetch-by-stage ingested javascript` batch, run
   `python3 ./scripts/prune_vendor_cases.py "$DIR/cases.db"` so vendor / runtime / chunk /
   polyfill / source-map noise is marked `stage=clean` without burning a source-analyzer
   dispatch (Rule 6 in operator-core).
6. Coverage hygiene (carried over): when coverage-expanding source batches remain
   (`ingested api-spec`, `ingested javascript`, `ingested unknown`, or a seed-like
   `ingested page` such as the root/bootstrap page), prefer draining one of those before
   another API-family batch. Once only low-yield `page`/`stylesheet`/`data` backlog remains,
   switch back to API-family testing — don't let static-asset churn starve high-signal work.
7. Outcome-recording bash blocks must NOT also prefetch the next non-empty batch unless the
   SAME turn will immediately launch the matching `task(...)`. NEVER combine outcome
   recording with a `fetch_batch_to_file.sh` call in the same bash invocation.
8. If credentials land in auth.json during this loop, dispatch a bounded exploit-developer
   auth-validation task in the SAME turn. The next `auth_respawn_check.sh` tick will write
   `.auth-respawn-required`, signalling re-dispatch of recon-specialist + source-analyzer
   with auth context (operator-core Credential Auto-Use).
9. Continue until `stats-by-stage` shows zero cases at `ingested|source_analyzed|
   vuln_confirmed|fuzz_pending`, zero rows in `processing`, and recon-specialist has
   returned at least once (Rule 5 stop condition).

Before leaving Test:
- `./scripts/reconcile_surface_coverage.sh "$DIR" --ingest-followups`
- `./scripts/check_collection_health.sh "$DIR"`
- `./scripts/check_surface_coverage.sh "$DIR"`

If either gate fails, do not advance — drain the new follow-up cases or resolve unresolved
surfaces per Rule 7.

### Phase 4: EXPLOIT (residual chains + ad-hoc rounds)

Under the streaming pipeline, exploit-developer runs continuously by stage —
`fetch-by-stage vuln_confirmed <type> <limit> exploit-developer` happens inside the Phase 3
loop, not at a separate phase entry. osint-analyst is dispatched only when
`intel_changed_check.sh` writes `.osint-respawn-required` (idempotent high-water mark on
intel.md filled rows). There is no fan-out gate that pairs them at "phase 4 entry".

What still belongs here: by the time active stages drain, the bulk of exploit work is done.
For residuals, dispatch ad-hoc rounds with the relevant artifacts:
- Full-findings review (pass `findings.md`) when chain candidates are visible across
  multiple findings.
- Chain hypothesis dispatches with the specific `FINDING-EX-NNN` set you want chained.
- Reassess severity based on confirmed impact; update findings.md severity in place.

If the recent intel.md churn has not yet triggered an osint-respawn pass, run
`./scripts/intel_changed_check.sh "$DIR"` once to flag any pending correlation work.

### Phase 5: REPORT

Dispatch report-writer with the engagement directory. See `operator-core.md` Rule 8 for the
full contract (interim snapshots via `compose_partial_report.sh`, partial-marker cleanup,
and `finalize_engagement.sh` as the only allowed finalization command).

**INTERACTIVE**: request user approval at each phase transition.
**AUTONOMOUS**: never ask approval, run cross-stage in parallel, errors → log and continue.

## Appendix A: Wildcard Mode

Only read this section if Step 1 detected wildcard mode.

### Phase 0: Enumerate Subdomains

```bash
DOMAIN="<root domain>"
PARENT_DIR="engagements/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-$(date +%H%M%S)-wildcard-${DOMAIN//\./-}"
mkdir -p "$PARENT_DIR/scans"
source scripts/lib/container.sh && export ENGAGEMENT_DIR="$PARENT_DIR"
run_tool subfinder -d "$DOMAIN" -all -silent -o $DIR/scans/subdomains_raw.txt
```

Then follow subdomain-enumeration skill for 3-stage filter (DNS → web port → fingerprint).

### Phase 0.5: Prioritize

**INTERACTIVE**: Present prioritized list, get approval.
**AUTONOMOUS**: Announce order, immediately start.

### Phase 0.9: Sliding Window

Process max N subdomains in parallel (default 3). Each runs full 5-phase flow with engagement-scoped proxy/Katana containers.
When one completes → start next. NEVER create all directories upfront.

WAF gate check before each: skip if 403 + Cloudflare/CloudFront challenge.

### Phase FINAL: Consolidated Report

Merge all child findings.md into parent report.md.

## User Arguments

The target and any additional context from the user follows:
